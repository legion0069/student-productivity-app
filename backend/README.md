# Backend

This is the backend for the Student Productivity App.
Today I created the basic server file (index.js) which will run on port 5000.

Next Steps:
- Add a task structure
- Add API to create and list tasks


## Day 9 Update
- Introduced dotenv-based configuration (.env).
- Extracted all persistence logic into taskStore.js.
- Prepared backend for future migration to MongoDB (MONGO_URI in .env).
