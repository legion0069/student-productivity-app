# Day 10 Progress  
Date: 2025-11-24

## Completed
- Added a `/health` endpoint on the backend to expose basic service status.
- Implemented a `/stats` endpoint to return task counts and completion percentage from the backend.
- Improved the root `README.md` with:
  - Clear feature list
  - Tech stack
  - Project structure
  - Run instructions
  - API overview
- Confirmed that the frontend continues to work correctly with the refactored backend.

## Why this is important
- The project now looks more like a real-world service with monitoring-style endpoints.
- The README is recruiter-friendly and makes it easy for others to run and review the app.
- Project 1 (Student Productivity App) feels complete and polished for a portfolio.

## Next (Project 2 – starting Day 11)
- Begin working on the AI Image Captioning Mini-Tool (Python + ML).
- Set up a separate folder/repo or subfolder for Project 2.
- Plan environment, dataset, and initial model structure.
