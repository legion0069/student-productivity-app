# Day 8 Progress  
Date: 2025-11-22

## Completed
- Added a dedicated AppHeader component with title and subtitle.
- Restructured the layout into clear sections (toolbar, form, stats, task list).
- Implemented a new dark-themed UI with better spacing, typography, and colors.
- Improved mobile responsiveness for small screens.

## Why this matters
- The app now looks more polished and professional.
- Easier for a recruiter or reviewer to understand and navigate.
- Sets a good visual standard for future features.

## Next (Day 9)
- Prepare for backend migration to MongoDB or a proper DB.
- Add environment-based config (API base URL).
- Clean up minor code duplication and comments.
